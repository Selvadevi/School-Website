      <div id="abt">Preschool is an early childhood program in which children 
        combine learning with play in a program run by professionally 
        trained adults. Children are most commonly enrolled in preschool
         between the ages of three and five, 
        though those as young as two can attend some schools.
        Early childhood is considered to be the most important 
        phase of development. Healthy early child development,
         which includes physical, social/emotional, and linguistic/cognitive
          development (each equally important), strongly affect mental 
        and physical health, literacy and numeracy skills, life success.</div>

    <h2>5 Must-Have Facilities in Preschool For Better Learning 
        Environment</h2>
    <h3>Library</h3>
    <p>Libraries for children are essential preschool facilities 
        for information and development. Either a library room or a 
        small space that the children can use independently to browse books.
         In preschool, the library should be a kid-friendly place where 
         children can go to read books, this facility helps 
        to develop their READING HABITS since young.</p>

    <h1>Creative Area</h1>
<p>There are so many ways for children to explore and be creative. The creative area in a preschool classroom is a place where your little children can go creatively in drawing, expressing and playing.

It doesn’t have to be a specific drawing area or learning area, but it’s a place for the children to HAVE FUN and LEARN at the same time. It’s a place where they 
can choose to do what they love, it helps develop their interest too!</p>
